    "### Case study project exercise\n",
    "\n",
    "Create a web API server that exposes process, memory and CPU usage information\n",
    "of a cluster of nodes in a network.  \n",
    "\n",
    "This project would consist of the following components:\n",
    "  - An API server\n",
    "    - This is a central component that should run on a host and provide services for fetching process, memory and CPU usage statistics of a given node in the network.\n",
    "    - The server must also support gathering process, memory and CPU statistics via remote agents running on each node.\n",
    "    - The server must persist all statistics on a database and allow fetching past details.\n",
    "  - Agent\n",
    "    - This is a python program that runs on each node to be monitored. \n",
    "    - This program must periodically fetch process, memory and CPU usage statistics of the current node and relay the same to the API server.\n",
    "  - Client\n",
    "    - This is a python program to test the server by fetching process, memory and CPU usage statistics using API call to the server\n",
    "\n",
    "An example transcript of the client API call to the server:\n",
