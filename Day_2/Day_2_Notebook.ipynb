    "##### Active Threads vs Daemon Threads\n",
    " - Active Threads keep the python process active. Python process exits when all active threads terminate. By default the main thread of the python process is an active thread, so are threads created and started using ```Thread``` instances when their daemon attribute is not set.\n",
    "\n",
    " - Daemon Threads are automatically terminated when there are no more Active Threads alive in a python process. A daemon thread can be created by setting the ```daemon=True``` argument while constructing the Thread class, or setting the ```.daemon``` attribute to True to a Thread instance before the thread's ```.start()``` method is invoked.\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Common use-cases for Daemon Threads\n",
    " - Heart-beat monitoring threads\n",
    " - Housekeeping / routine cleanup threads\n",
    " - Most daemon threads are designed to run an infinite loop that waits for an event or timed sleep, wakes up and perform a routine activities\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Important notes\n",
    " 1. Caution must be exercised if a daemon thread should be use resources managed by active threads. For example, reading from files which could be closed by active threads can lead to runtime errors in daemon threads that could not be gracefully handled.\n",
    " 2. It is pointless to ```join()``` on a daemon thread as that will keep the active thread alive and waiting until the daemon thread exits."
